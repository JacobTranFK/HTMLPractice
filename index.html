<h1 style="color:White; font-size: 40px"> Why is Sonic still beloved? </h1>
<p> Sonic has been around since the rise of gaming, bursting onto the scene in 1991 with the release of the original <b><i>Sonic The Hedgehog</b></i> on the Sega Genesis. Ever since then, Sonic has become a juggernaut in the gaming industry. He practically dominated the 90s and early 2000s, earning the title of Mario's rival. Nowadays though, Sonic has rather taken a step back. His newer games have either mixed or negative reviews from both critics and players. But that begs the question, why is Sonic still loved by most players? </p>

<h2 style="color:White;"> The History of Sonic </h2>
<p>Being a icon of the gaming industry for 30 years means that the blue blur has a lot of history behind him. A crashcourse will help us answer the question of this topic.</p>

<h2>Classic Era (1991-1997)</h2>

<p> The classic era took place from 1991-1997 and is the start of Sonic's legacy. The era contained the original trilogy, Sonic 1, 2, 3 and Knuckles along with the spin-offs such as Sonic R. The games were very well recieved and considered arguably the best in the gaming world at the time. This spot in Sonic's time would come to an end with the release of <b><i>Sonic Adventure</i></b> in 1998.

<h2>Adventure/Dreamcast Era (1998-2005)</h2>

<p>The Dreamcast era was the successor to the classic era and began in 1999 with the release of the first sonic adventure game. This period was considered the peak of Sonic with the blue hedgehog becoming one of if not the most popular video game icon at the time. This era was also the start of the fall for Sonic with a few questionable games released by Sega at the time. This time would come to a weak end with the release of <b><i>Shadow the Hedgehog</b></i> in 2005. </p>

<h2>Dark Age Era (2006-2009)</h2>

<p>The dark age era marked the beginning of a new page, Modern Sonic. The dark age era started in 2006 with the release of <b><i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2006.</i></b> The game here were not well recieved at all, being one of the worst times in Sonic's history. This time came to an end in 2009.

<h2>Meta Era (2010-Present)</h2>

<p> The modern era is the current era of Sonic and the longest so far. It started off okay with the release of <b><i>Sonic Colors</i></b> in 2010. It continued this hot start with the release of <b><i>Sonic Generations</b></i> in 2011. Generations was a huge success, being considered arguably the best game in the history of the blue blur. It was followed up with disappointment after disappointment until the release of Sonic Mania in 2017. Mania was different from the other meta era games with it being in the 16 bit style and clearly being a classic game. It was a hit with the fans, racking up great reviews from the masses. Mania was also followed up by disappointment with <b><i>Sonic Forces</b></i> also coming out in the same year. Sonic fell into dormancy with only <b><i>Team Sonic Racing (2019)</b></i> being released since then. Sonic's 30th anniversary came around and Sonic Central was announced. It was here they revealed Sonic Colors Ultimate for 2021 and Sonic Frontiers for 2022.

<h2 style="color:White;"> What Now? </h2>

<p> Now that we've completed the crash course, how can we use what Sonic's history has told us to answer the question we've been asking? It's a bit simple actually. Sonic has always been apart of the internet since the beginning, racing onto the scene and immediately making his mark by creating video games geared towards everyone. Sonic simply impacted the lives of many internet users for almost 30 years, creating a sense of culture around this blue hedgehog. But due to his games becoming lackluster in recent times, he had taken quite the fall in popularity, going from the top of the world to taking the backseat. This right here is why Sonic is still loved by its fanbase despite a bleak outlook on his modern history, people want him to succeed. Sonic has earned the reputation of an underdog, a legendary icon looking to take back his spot on top. </p>

<h2 style="color:White;"> Sonic's Future </h2>

<p> Sonic's future looks strong, despite the many failures of the past. He is looking to make his mark in the 2020's with the release of Sonic Frontiers in the holiday season of 2022. The game will be an open world adventure centered around the brand new Starfall Islands. The intial trailer for the game was introduced during the 2021 Game Awards receiving massive hype from the fans, hoping for Sonic's redemption arc. It's hard to say what will happen but the fans will support our favorite hedgehog the rest of the way.
